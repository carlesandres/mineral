### Colored labels
Each file is automatically given a color label to make it easier to find it later.

You can change the colours as a way of classifying your notes.

### Send to Bin
Send any note to the **Bin** folder to get them out of the way
from where you decide to recover it later or delete it forever.

### And more...
* Quick content preview from the **List**
* Create a new file with a link
