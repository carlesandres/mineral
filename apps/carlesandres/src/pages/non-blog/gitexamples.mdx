# How I'm building gitexamples.com

Before I write a more stable version of this, I want to mention what I am using to build [gitexamples.com](gitexamples.com) at the moment.

The main production dependencies are:

- Next.js
- Supabase
- TailWindCSS
- shadcn/ui
- recharts (for the stats page)
- lucide-react (for the icons)


And in my development process, I am using:

- Vercel for hosting
- GitHub for source control
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- EsLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- My own second-brain app for tracking my progress and ideas (still in development)

The site is written in Typescript and makes use of React Server Components as much as possible.

I am using Next.js middleware to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

I will add more details to this in a future update.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out on X if you wanna know more.
