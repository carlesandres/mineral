# Tools I use

## Software development

These are the main tools I use for software development.

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) 
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [Tmux](hhttps://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

### Tmux plugins

- Tmux resurrect
- Tmux Floax

My dotfiles organisation is embarrassingly bad, so I'll wait until I've fixed
that before sharing them.


## Productivity

- Raycast
- Arc browser
- 1password
- Notnot.app (my own app, still in development)
