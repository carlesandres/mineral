# Welcome to my non-blog

Hi there!

I'm going this call it a non-blog because I don't plan to follow any of the usual blog conventions.

In particular, these are the rules I plan to follow (or not):

- Posts are mostly for myself. To help me remember things. To help me get better at writing. To help me get better at thinking.
- I will rewrite any posts whenever I feel like it. I will ruthlessly remove and modify content.
- I will change these rules whenever I feel like it.

Even this post is likely to be updated or deleted in the future without warning.
