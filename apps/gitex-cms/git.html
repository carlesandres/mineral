    <h1>NAME</h1>
    <p>
      git-blame - Show what revision and author last modified each line of a
      file
    </p>
    <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
    <pre><code>git blame [-c] [-b] [-l] [--root] [-t] [-f] [-n] [-s] [-e] [-p] [-w] [--incremental]
            [-L &lt;range&gt;] [-S &lt;revs-file&gt;] [-M] [-C] [-C] [-C] [--since=&lt;date&gt;]
            [--ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;] [--ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;]
            [--color-lines] [--color-by-age] [--progress] [--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;]
            [&lt;rev&gt; | --contents &lt;file&gt; | --reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;] [--] &lt;file&gt;</code></pre>
    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <p>
      Annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision
      which last modified the line. Optionally, start annotating from the given
      revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      When specified one or more times, <strong>-L</strong> restricts annotation
      to the requested lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file renames
      (currently there is no option to turn the rename-following off). To follow
      lines moved from one file to another, or to follow lines that were copied
      and pasted from another file, etc., see the <strong>-C</strong> and
      <strong>-M</strong> options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report does not tell you anything about lines which have been deleted
      or replaced; you need to use a tool such as <em>git diff</em> or the
      "pickaxe" interface briefly mentioned in the following paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from supporting file annotation, Git also supports searching the
      development history for when a code snippet occurred in a change. This
      makes it possible to track when a code snippet was added to a file, moved
      or copied between files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It works by
      searching for a text string in the diff. A small example of the pickaxe
      interface that searches for <strong>blame_usage</strong>:

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This can also be controlled via
        the <strong>blame.blankBoundary</strong> config option.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--root</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can also be controlled via
        the <strong>blame.showRoot</strong> config option.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--show-stats</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Include additional statistics at the end of blame output.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;, -L :&lt;funcname&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Annotate only the line range given by
        <em>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</em>, or by the function name regex
        <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>. May be specified multiple times. Overlapping
        ranges are allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> are optional.
        <strong>-L &lt;start&gt;</strong> or
        <strong>-L &lt;start&gt;,</strong> spans from <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> to
        end of file. <strong>-L ,&lt;end&gt;</strong> spans from start of file
        to <em>&lt;end&gt;</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> can take one of these
        forms:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>·</p>
        <p>number</p>
        <p>
          If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a number, it
          specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>·</p>
        <p><strong>/regex/</strong></p>
        <p>
          This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex. If
          <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is a regex, it will search from the end of the
          previous <strong>-L</strong> range, if any, otherwise from the start
          of file. If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is <strong>^/regex/</strong>, it
          will search from the start of file. If <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a
          regex, it will search starting at the line given by
          <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>·</p>
        <p>+offset or -offset</p>
        <p>
          This is only valid for <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> and will specify a number
          of lines before or after the line given by <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> is given in place of
        <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em>, it is a regular
        expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that
        matches <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>, up to the next funcname line.
        <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> searches from the end of the previous
        <strong>-L</strong> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file.
        <strong>^:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> searches from the start of file. The
        function names are determined in the same way as
        <strong>git diff</strong> works out patch hunk headers (see
        <em>Defining a custom hunk-header</em> in
        <strong>gitattributes</strong>(5)).

    <p>-l</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>--reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing the
        revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last revision in which
        a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like START..END
        where the path to blame exists in START.
        <strong>git blame --reverse START</strong> is taken as
        <strong>git blame --reverse START..HEAD</strong> for convenience.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--first-parent</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This
        option can be used to determine when a line was introduced to a
        particular integration branch, rather than when it was introduced to the
        history overall.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>-p, --porcelain</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Show in a format designed for machine consumption.</p>

      <p>
        Show the porcelain format, but output commit information for each line,
        not just the first time a commit is referenced. Implies --porcelain.

    <p>--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Specifies the encoding used to output author names and commit summaries.
        Setting it to <strong>none</strong> makes blame output unconverted data.
        For more information see the discussion about encoding in the
        <strong>git-log</strong>(1) manual page.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--contents &lt;file&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When &lt;rev&gt; is not specified, the command annotates the changes
        starting backwards from the working tree copy. This flag makes the
        command pretend as if the working tree copy has the contents of the
        named file (specify <strong>-</strong> to make the command read from the
        standard input).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--date &lt;format&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Specifies the format used to output dates. If --date is not provided,
        the value of the blame.date config variable is used. If the blame.date
        config variable is also not set, the iso format is used. For supported
        values, see the discussion of the --date option at
        <strong>git-log</strong>(1).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--[no-]progress</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
        it is attached to a terminal. This flag enables progress reporting even
        if not attached to a terminal. Can’t use
        <strong>--progress</strong> together with
        <strong>--porcelain</strong> or <strong>--incremental</strong>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>-M[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit moves or
        copies a block of lines (e.g. the original file has A and then B, and
        the commit changes it to B and then A), the traditional
        <em>blame</em> algorithm notices only half of the movement and typically
        blames the lines that were moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns
        blame to the lines that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child commit.
        With this option, both groups of lines are blamed on the parent by
        running extra passes of inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
        alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying within a
        file for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. The default
        value is 20.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>-C[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In addition to <strong>-M</strong>, detect lines moved or copied from
        other files that were modified in the same commit. This is useful when
        you reorganize your program and move code around across files. When this
        option is given twice, the command additionally looks for copies from
        other files in the commit that creates the file. When this option is
        given three times, the command additionally looks for copies from other
        files in any commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
        alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying between
        files for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. And the
        default value is 40. If there are more than one
        <strong>-C</strong> options given, the &lt;num&gt; argument of the last
        <strong>-C</strong> will take effect.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>--ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Ignore changes made by the revision when assigning blame, as if the
        change never happened. Lines that were changed or added by an ignored
        commit will be blamed on the previous commit that changed that line or
        nearby lines. This option may be specified multiple times to ignore more
        than one revision. If the <strong>blame.markIgnoredLines</strong> config
        option is set, then lines that were changed by an ignored commit and
        attributed to another commit will be marked with a <strong>?</strong> in
        the blame output. If the <strong>blame.markUnblamableLines</strong>
        config option is set, then those lines touched by an ignored commit that
        we could not attribute to another revision are marked with a
        <em>*</em>.

    </blockquote>
    <p>--ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Ignore revisions listed in <strong>file</strong>, which must be in the
        same format as an <strong>fsck.skipList</strong>. This option may be
        repeated, and these files will be processed after any files specified
        with the <strong>blame.ignoreRevsFile</strong> config option. An empty
        file name, <strong>""</strong>, will clear the list of revs from
        previously processed files.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Color line annotations in the default format differently if they come
        from the same commit as the preceding line. This makes it easier to
        distinguish code blocks introduced by different commits. The color
        defaults to cyan and can be adjusted using the
        <strong>color.blame.repeatedLines</strong> config option.

    <h1>THE DEFAULT FORMAT</h1>
    <p>
      When neither <strong>--porcelain</strong> nor
      <strong>--incremental</strong> option is specified,
      <strong>git blame</strong> will output annotation for each line with:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>abbreviated object name for the commit the line came from;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>
        author ident (by default author name and date, unless
        <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-e</strong> is specified); and
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>line number</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>before the line contents.</p>
    <h1>THE PORCELAIN FORMAT</h1>
    <p>
      In this format, each line is output after a header; the header at the
      minimum has the first line which has:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>40-byte SHA-1 of the commit the line is attributed to;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>the line number of the line in the original file;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>the line number of the line in the final file;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>
        on a line that starts a group of lines from a different commit than the
        previous one, the number of lines in this group. On subsequent lines
        this field is absent.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This header line is followed by the following information at least once
      for each commit:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>
        the author name ("author"), email ("author-mail"), time ("author-time"),
        and time zone ("author-tz"); similarly for committer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>the filename in the commit that the line is attributed to.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>·</p>
      <p>the first line of the commit log message ("summary").</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The contents of the actual line is output after the above header, prefixed
      by a TAB. This is to allow adding more header elements later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porcelain format generally suppresses commit information that has
      already been seen. For example, two lines that are blamed to the same
      commit will both be shown, but the details for that commit will be shown
      only once. This is more efficient, but may require more state be kept by
      the reader. The <strong>--line-porcelain</strong> option can be used to
      output full commit information for each line, allowing simpler (but less
      efficient) usage like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code># count the number of lines attributed to each author
git blame --line-porcelain file |
sed -n &#39;s/^author //p&#39; |
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h1>SPECIFYING RANGES</h1>
    <p>
      Unlike <em>git blame</em> and <em>git annotate</em> in older versions of
      git, the extent of the annotation can be limited to both line ranges and
      revision ranges. The <strong>-L</strong> option, which limits annotation
      to a range of lines, may be specified multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for file
      <strong>foo</strong>, you can use the <strong>-L</strong> option like so
      (they mean the same thing — both ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>git blame -L 40,60 foo
git blame -L 40,+21 foo</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Also you can use a regular expression to specify the line range:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>git blame -L &#39;/^sub hello {/,/^}$/&#39; foo</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      which limits the annotation to the body of the
      <strong>hello</strong> subroutine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are not interested in changes older than version v2.6.18, or
      changes older than 3 weeks, you can use revision range specifiers similar
      to <em>git rev-list</em>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo
git blame --since=3.weeks -- foo</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When revision range specifiers are used to limit the annotation, lines
      that have not changed since the range boundary (either the commit v2.6.18
      or the most recent commit that is more than 3 weeks old in the above
      example) are blamed for that range boundary commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has lines created by
      copy-and-paste from existing files. Sometimes this indicates that the
      developer was being sloppy and did not refactor the code properly. You can
      first find the commit that introduced the file with:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and then annotate the change between the commit and its parents, using
      <strong>commit^!</strong> notation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h1>INCREMENTAL OUTPUT</h1>
    <p>
      When called with <strong>--incremental</strong> option, the command
      outputs the result as it is built. The output generally will talk about
      lines touched by more recent commits first (i.e. the lines will be
      annotated out of order) and is meant to be used by interactive viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output format is similar to the Porcelain format, but it does not
      contain the actual lines from the file that is being annotated.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>Each blame entry always starts with a line of:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code>&lt;40-byte hex sha1&gt; &lt;sourceline&gt; &lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num_lines&gt;</code></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Line numbers count from 1.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>2.</p>
      <p>
        The first time that a commit shows up in the stream, it has various
        other information about it printed out with a one-word tag at the
        beginning of each line describing the extra commit information (author,
        email, committer, dates, summary, etc.).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>3.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike the Porcelain format, the filename information is always given
        and terminates the entry:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code>&quot;filename&quot; &lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;</code></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        and thus it is really quite easy to parse for some line- and
        word-oriented parser (which should be quite natural for most scripting
        languages).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
        <p>
          <br />
          For people who do parsing: to make it more robust, just ignore any
          lines between the first and last one ("&lt;sha1&gt;" and "filename"
          lines) where you do not recognize the tag words (or care about that
          particular one) at the beginning of the "extended information" lines.
          That way, if there is ever added information (like the commit encoding
          or extended commit commentary), a blame viewer will not care.
